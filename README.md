# YOGUSITA THEMES!

VSCode themes made by me, for me ðŸŒ¼

This is a work in progress, so expect some rough edges ðŸ’©

## Themes

### First

My first theme! YAY! - Literally called "first"

This is a test theme and I've been having a blast learning what kind of pallete I like and all the options vscode gives to color away~.

The original idea was to have something inspired by sakura flowers but in a dark-ish theme. Idk if you can see it, I don't blame you if you don't
